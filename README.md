# Work Conventions
## Code Style
* We follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines wherever applicable.
* The character limit for each line of code is at column 80.

## Git Workflow
* Changes to the master branch must always be reviewed by the other person.
* When coding together commits can be made directly to the master branch.
* Asynchronous development happens on personal branches:
  * Once a development step is done a pull request is made.
  * The other person then reviews the pull request and merges to master if everything is okay.
